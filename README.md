# Starship Enterprise Computer

### Inspired by Mark Zuckerberg's setting (and completing) a personal 2016 tech goal of creating his own AI, I decided that my tech goal for 2017 would be to build the lcars computer from the Starship Enterprise!

- I'm using the Annyang library with AngularJS to build voice commands that will allow me to tell my computer to do any number of things.
- I want to set up a server on a Raspberry pi to control technology around my house.
- I'm building the front end in pure CSS. Part of it will be modeled after some of the screens used on Star Trek, with readouts for ship data and such, and part of it will be an area to display information that's returned from voice commands.

## If you look at the project and think of any cool functionality that should be added, let me know! I want to build as much functionality into lcars as possible!
